On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.', 'location': 'Iran', 'webURL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/magazine/asghar-farhadis-iran-film.html', 'imageURL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/images/2019/02/03/magazine/03mag-Farhadi-image01/03mag-Farhadi-image01-articleLarge.jpg'}, {'year': 2019, 'month': 1, 'datetime': '2019-01-31T10:00:12+00:00', 'section': 'U.S.', 'subsection': 'null', 'headline': 'A narrow, 150-foot-long tunnel discovered on Tuesday was directed toward a Chase bank near Miami.
