The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature — from formal gardens to underground caves — for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: “As I walked through all the narrow streets,” she says, “my gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies.” Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Miró, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series — now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City — is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche.

Born in a remote province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Viertel made her way in the 1920s to Hollywood, where she had a career as a screenwriter and became a confidante of Greta Garbo.

The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. “It’s now less fiesta and more tavern,” Mr. Stupak said. The menu will feature tacos, as well as fried-chicken sandwiches, broiled oysters with hoja santa and bacon, Chihuahua cheese sticks, pork fried rice and crunchy corn masa ice cream bars.

He edited the “Encyclopédie,” for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts.
