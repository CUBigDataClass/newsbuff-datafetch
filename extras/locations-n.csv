THE $1.4 BILLION IN MILITARY SALES CREDITS SUBMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ISRAEL MAY BE INCREASED BY $200 MILLION, LEGISLATIVE SOURCES SAID. THE APPROPRIATION BILL FOR FINANCING FOREIGN AID FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WAS SCUTTLED LAST WEEK BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE WHEN INFORMAL TALKS WITH REPUBLICANS INDICATED THAT THE REQUESTED FUNDS WOULD RISK SHARP CUTBACKS IN A FLOOR DEBATE. FINANCING WILL BE PROVIDED BY A CONTINUNG RESOLUTION MAINTAINING THE SAME LEVEL OF AID FOR THE COMING YEAR AS DURING FISCAL 1980, WITH A FEW AMENDMENTS. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROPOSED AT A SENATE-HOUSE CONFERENCE ON A CONTINUING RESOLUTION WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MILITARY SALES CREDITS TO ISRAEL AND MORE MONEY FOR REFUGEE PROGRAMS THAT PUT A BURDEN ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS THE SETTLING OF CUBAN AND HAITIAN REFUGEES IN FLORIDA.
